# Avalanche-Module2_Assessment
This project is the final assessment of Module 2 of Avalanche (Smart Contract Management - ETH + AVAX)

## Description
These code snippets collectively facilitate the development, deployment, and interaction with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This Solidity smart contract serves as a financial management tool, allowing users to deposit and withdraw ether while maintaining transaction records and ensuring account balances remain accurate. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the deployed contract, enabling actions such as connecting MetaMask wallets, viewing balances, and conducting transactions. 

### How to Start-Up
Follow these steps to execute the code:

1. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
2. Inside the project directory, in the first terminal type: npm i
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
